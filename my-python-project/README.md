# My Python Project

This project is a simple Python application that takes user input and checks if the input number is greater than or equal to 10. Depending on the input, it will print "Yes" if the condition is met and "No" otherwise.

## Files

- **src/iwi131.py**: Contains the main script for the application.
- **requirements.txt**: This file is currently empty but can be populated with necessary Python packages as the project evolves.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```
   python src/iwi131.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter a number.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you would like to contribute to the project.
